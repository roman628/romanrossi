                    <h1>About Me</h1>
                    <p>I'm a dedicated Computer Science student at James Madison University with a passion for creating efficient solutions through programming. My journey in computer science started at a young age, and I've since developed expertise in various programming languages and technologies. I'm particularly interested in automation, web development, and creating practical applications that solve real-world problems.</p>

                    <h2>Life Outside Code</h2>
                    <p>When I'm not staring at a screen, Im at the beach during summer breaks,  I've been getting more into skimboarding the past few years. I try to make it out for at least a week each summer, plus some weekend trips when I can. I love going to the ice rink to skate, I've never played hockey but I'm pretty good on the ice, and I used to play soccer with friends and even joined an intramural team in college until a twisted ankle sidelined me last semester.</p>
                    
                    <p>I also get out on the golf course with my dad whenever I can. It's become one of our favorite ways to spend time together, and I've gotten pretty decent at it over the years. Music has been a big part of my life too - I took piano lessons for 12 years, and while I don't practice as religiously as I used to, I still sit down at the keys when I have some free time.</p>
                    
                    <p>Recently, between classes, homework, and hitting the gym, I'm usually coding projects. There's something really satisfying about building apps and tools that I can actually use in my daily life. I enjoy the problem-solving aspect of programming, especially when I can automate tasks or create algorithms that might have some practical value over time.</p>

                    <h2>Entertainment & Interests</h2>
                    <p>I'm a big fan of both the Harry Potter books and movies. I love horro movies, The Conjuring series is a favorite, and anything by Stephen King. I also love shows like Regular Show, Adventure Time, Rick and Morty.</p>
                    
                    <p>My music taste is all over the place - I bounce between rap, indie, classic rock, and pop. I listen to a lot of $uicideboy$, Steve Lacy, Earl Sweatshirt, Tyler The Creator, and Mac Miller. I'll run through Don Toliver, Uzi, Juice WRLD, and Childish Gambino's albums for hours. I'm constantly making new playlists, I got like hundreds of them by now.</p>

                    <h2>Technical Passion</h2>
                    <p>My interest in computer science goes beyond academic coursework. I regularly create practical applications and automation tools that solve real-world problems. From web scraping solutions to multi-threaded applications, I enjoy the challenge of turning complex problems into efficient solutions. I'm particularly proud of the various tools I've developed that help automate everyday tasks and make processes more efficient.</p>
